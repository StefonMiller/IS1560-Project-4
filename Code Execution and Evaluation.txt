I have included a screenshot of the results of my code execution on my machine with 8GB of RAM and an i5 processor.
From the screenshot, it can be seen that my script finishes executing just under the 3 minute mark at ~2 minutes and 45
seconds. The results of my script indicate that the relevance feedback incorporated into the results changed the rank order
of multiple documents. In my output for project 3, the highest ranked document for Query 1 was a XIE document and after
incorporating feedback it is an NTY document. I'm not sure if the code will finish in under 5 minutes on the test machine,
but it did on my own so I hope that will suffice for full credit. My code was executing using Python version 3.8.9 on VSCode.
